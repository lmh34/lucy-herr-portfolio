<br>
<br>
Can flight delays be predicted in advance of their scheduled departures? This Machine Learning at Scale project used Spark, Databricks, and 5 years of U.S. flight and weather data to predict flight delays of at least 15 minutes at 2 hours in advance of scheduled departure.

[MIDS Capstone: Sentanyl - Forecasting the Fentanyl Epidemic](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/Sentanyl/#)
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The devastating impacts of the fentanyl epidemic have skyrocketed over recent years: in California alone, this potent synthetic opioid was responsible for over 10,000 deaths last year. In the ongoing battle to prevent fatal overdoses, proactive resource mobilization makes the difference between life and death.
<br>
<br> 
Sentanyl is the first publicly available tool for localized fentanyl overdose forecasting, generating estimates within +/-1 death per 100K population on average. Public health stakeholders can use Sentanyl’s dashboard to leverage these novel insights, optimize future resource allocation, and, ultimately, save lives.

<br>
Which state-of-the-art NLP models are the most effective solutions for detecting sensitive user data in unstructured text? This natural language processing project trained SpaCy, BERT, deBERTa, and bi-LSTM models using Tensorflow/Keras to perform token classification of personal identifiable information (PII) in a large student essay dataset.

<br>
Can we predict pet adoption rates using adoption profile text, image, and sentiment data? This Applied Machine Learning project used XGBoost, neural networks, and Transformers architectures to classify predicted adoption rates to advise shelters and adoption agencies.

## Additional Projects
<br>
<br>
[Causal Inference: Driving B2C Web Traffic with A/B Testing and Google Analytics](/pdf/241_sip_the_difference_fp.pdf)
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/241_user_device.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
<br>
Does a paid Google SEO ad campaign with wellness and lifestyle-oriented messaging generate more site traffic than one with productivity-oriented messaging? This causal inference project partnered with Vyu for the launch of the Tune In supplement drink line and used Google Analytics to A/B test distinct product campaigns.

[Data Engineering: Optimizing Delivery Routing with Neo4j and NoSQL Databases](/pdf/W205_final_presentation.pdf)
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/205_locker_map.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
<br>
This data engineering case study addressed integrating new technologies into a client company’s platform for expanding service locations, meal delivery, and customer base in the Bay Area. We used graph algorithms with Neo4J, MongoDB, and Redis to determine optimal delivery locations and routes and architect scalable database solutions.

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/203_data.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
<br>
This statistics project used regression to explore the effects of ad spending, runtime, and user demographics on the number of impressions received by Snapchat political ads.
